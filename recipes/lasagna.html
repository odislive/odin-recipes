            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Start by making the Meat Sauce:
                  <ol>
                    <li>In a large saucepan, heat 30 milliliters of olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until they become translucent.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef and cook until it's browned and crumbled, breaking it apart with a spoon as it cooks.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste.</li>
                    <li>Season the sauce with dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              
                <li>While the meat sauce is simmering, prepare the Béchamel Sauce:
                  <ol>
                    <li>In a separate saucepan, melt 50 grams of butter over low heat.</li>
                    <li>Add 50 grams of all-purpose flour and whisk continuously to make a roux. Cook for a few minutes until it's light golden in color.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour in 500 milliliters of milk while whisking to prevent lumps. Continue cooking and whisking until the sauce thickens, usually for about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Season the Béchamel sauce with a pinch of ground nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Remove it from the heat.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              
                <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
                <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Now, it's time to assemble the lasagna:
                  <ol>
                    <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Spread a portion of the Béchamel sauce over the noodles.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle with a portion of grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
              </ol>
